## üì£ Introduction

[VisActor/VChart](https://github.com/VisActor/VChart) is a core chart component library of the open-source visualization solution VisActor by ByteDance. It is based on the visualization grammar library VGrammar and the rendering engine VRender, providing not only data presentation but also support for animation orchestration for narrative scenarios, rich interaction capabilities, and customizable chart styles. The simple and easy-to-use configuration greatly reduces the learning cost for users. Python, with its expressive syntax, is well-suited for data processing and AI scenarios. When data analysis and modeling meet data visualization, [pyecharts](https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts) and [py-vchart](https://github.com/VisActor/py-vchart) were born.

## ‚ú® Features

* API design similar to [pyecharts](https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts), smooth and fluent usage, supports method chaining
* Includes all charts from VChart, everything you need
* Supports mainstream Notebook environments, Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab (**Coming soon...**)
* Can be easily integrated into mainstream Web frameworks such as Flask, Sanic, Django (**Coming soon...**)
* Highly flexible configuration options, allowing for the creation of beautiful charts with ease
* Detailed documentation and examples to help developers get started quickly
